# ProcessKiller
Hate Microsoft Compatibility Telemetry that created a service to kill it. But can be used to kill any other processes if needed!

Polls and kills the processes as defined in the app.config file.

This was mainly done to kill Microsoft Compatibility Telemetry that I couldn't get rid of it by all means! It takes 100% CPU time!!!
